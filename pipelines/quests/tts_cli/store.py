Lives at audio/{quests,gossip}/*.mp3, gitignored. This is the project's most expensive

existed only inside a WoW install folder, where a game reinstall would destroy it.

The store is addressed by the same filenames the addon resolves, derived through
tts_cli.naming, so a file here can be copied into a data module unchanged.
