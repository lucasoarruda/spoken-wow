"""The corpus <-> Postgres round trip, and the seam that makes the table its source of truth.

The site edits lines, records who changed them and keeps what they used to say. None of
that could live in corpus/corpus.json.gz, so it lived in line_override instead: a patch
table keyed by file, with no history. This moves the corpus itself into Postgres beside
lore_line and book_line, and turns the committed file into an EXPORT of that table -- the
same arrangement zones has with tools/voice/manifest.json.

WHAT DOES NOT CHANGE: producing audio and building a sound pack still need no database.
tts_cli.build reads the committed file exactly as it always has,
and a clone with no Postgres can still ship a pack. That is the promise requirements.txt
makes, and the reason this is an import/export pair rather than a rewrite of the CLI.

WHY THIS IS PYTHON. The check that proves the table carries everything is that an import
followed by an export leaves corpus.json.gz byte-identical -- `git status` clean. Python
and Node do not produce identical gzip streams for the same input: the headers differ and
so does the deflate output. So the exporter has to be the same write_corpus that writes the
file today, which makes byte-identity true by construction instead of a coincidence between
two zlib builds.

THE CORPUS IS A FLAT LIST AND THIS TRANSCRIBES IT, defects included:

  * 103 lineIds name two different texts and one filename, so only the first is ever
    voiced. `variant` records which is which rather than collapsing them, because
    collapsing would change what ships for those files as a side effect of a schema choice.
  * 34 rows name a speaker that already appears for the same line, 19 identically and 15
    claiming a different voice. They are kept, because the export is what the addon build
    reads and dropping a row changes what ships.

Both are counted on every import and printed. Fixing them is a decision for whoever owns
the extract, made on purpose, in a commit that says so.
