//
// This is to lore_line what tools/voice/store.mjs is to the take table: the one seam
// that decides between Postgres and the files. Nothing else in tools/ talks to the
// lore table directly.
//
// recordScrape and recordRewrite are English-only, and say so in SQL rather than by
// assumption: a scrape reads the English wiki and a rewrite rewrites English prose,
// so both name lang = 'enUS' in SQL. The column stays because the table is shared and
// to them like the current version of the line and get versioned over.
//
// WITHOUT DATABASE_URL everything here still works, reading and writing
// addon/SpokenZones/Data/*.lua as the scrapers always did. That is not a courtesy: the
// addon build, validate.mjs and package-audio.sh all run on clones with no Postgres,
// and a corpus that could only be assembled by a database would take the whole release
// path with it.
