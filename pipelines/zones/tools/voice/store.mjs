// hold the zones copy of that, and the web app borrowed it.

//
//   DATABASE_URL set    -> the "take" table, the record itself
//   DATABASE_URL unset  -> tools/voice/manifest.json, an export of that table
//
// The file is an export, not a second record: export-manifest.mjs writes it from the
// database, and it is committed so that the addon can be built and reviewed without one.
