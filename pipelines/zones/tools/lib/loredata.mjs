// one constant.
//
// Four levels up, not two: this file is pipelines/zones/tools/lib/. The constant has to
// reach the repo root rather than the pipeline root because what it resolves is now
// split across the tree -- the lore corpus lives in addons/SpokenZones/Data/, the voice
// config in pipelines/zones/tools/voice/, the CurseForge descriptions in
// publishers/zones/ and the built zips in dist/. One root with full paths beats four
// roots.
//
// The override is what makes the explorer deployable. Next bundles these modules with
// webpack, which replaces `import.meta.url` with the *build machine's* path -- so a
// bundle built in CI carries a literal
// "file:///home/runner/work/wow-lore/wow-lore/tools/lib/loredata.mjs" and every path
// below it resolves to a directory that does not exist on the droplet. Deriving the
// root from the module's own location is right for a script and impossible for a
// bundle, so a deployed process says where the root is instead.
//
// Unset -- which is every local run, CLI or `next dev` -- this behaves exactly as it
// did before. See deploy/README.md for the full set.
