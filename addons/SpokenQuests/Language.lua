-- SpokenQuests -- the language axis of the sound packs.
--
-- A pack declares the language it was recorded in; the player says which language it
-- wants to hear and which to fall back on. Nothing else in this addon knows about
-- languages: DataModules asks this file which packs may answer a line, and in what order.
--
-- Three identifiers, deliberately distinct:
--
--   client locale     GetLocale(). What the client itself is running in, and the only
--                     thing a fresh install can guess a preference from.
--
--   pack language     X-SpokenQuests-Language on the pack's TOC. What was recorded.
--                     Absent means English: every pack published before this key
--                     existed is an English pack, and there is no other reading of
--                     silence that keeps those packs working.
--
--   voice language    What the player chose to hear. "auto" means follow the client.
--
-- The resolution order for one line is: the selected language, then the fallback
-- language, then silence. Not "any pack that has the line" -- a player who asked for
-- Portuguese and hears an English clip because that is what happened to be installed
-- has been given a bug, not a feature, and the fallback setting is where that choice
-- is made explicitly.
--
-- Gossip is same-language only and has no fallback: gossip lines are addressed by a
-- hash of the NPC's text as the *client* renders it, so a pack recorded against a
-- different client locale hashes its gossip differently and cannot be indexed by this
-- client's hashes at all. See DataModules:GetNPCGossipTextHash.

Language = {}

-- Every locale a supported client can run in, and therefore every language a pack may
-- declare. A code absent here is not a language: a pack declaring one is treated as
-- undeclared (English), because the alternative is a pack that silently answers nothing.
--
-- Kept deliberately in step with SpokenZones.LOCALES in addons/SpokenZones/Language.lua:
-- the two addons are installed side by side and a player who sets Portuguese in one and
-- finds no such option in the other has found a bug.
