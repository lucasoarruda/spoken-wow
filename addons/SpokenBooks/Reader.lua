-- ItemTextFrame is the whole of the book UI on all three targets, and it serves MAIL as
-- well: the same frame, the same events, the same getters. So the first question here is
-- never "which page is this" but "is this a book at all" -- a reader who opens a letter
-- from another player and hears it read aloud has been given somebody else's post by a
-- narrator, which is worse than hearing nothing.
--
-- Identification order, and each step earns its place:
--
--   1. title + page number + checksum   -- the normal path
--   2. checksum alone                   -- for a client whose object name differs from the
--                                          corpus's; only for checksums no other page shares
--   3. nothing                          -- silently, because the alternative is reading the
--                                          wrong page's words aloud
