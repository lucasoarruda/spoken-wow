==> done. What is left, in order:

  0. Put the stores on the block volume, before anything fills them:
       bash deploy/web/store.sh
     It replaces the directories just created with symlinks into /mnt/voice. The root
     disk has no room for the ~10 GB the cutover copies in.

  1. Write /srv/spoken/shared/app.env (mode 600, owned by deploy).
     deploy/web/README.md has the block. SPOKEN_SECRET_KEY must be copied from
     /srv/zonelore/shared/app.env's ZONELORE_SECRET_KEY, or every stored ElevenLabs
     credential imported at cutover is unopenable.

  2. From your workstation:  make web-deploy-scripts

  3. Restore the quests database, then apply the migrations:
       sudo -u postgres pg_dump voiceover | sudo -u postgres psql spoken
       /srv/spoken/bin/migrate.sh /srv/spoken/current      (after the first deploy)

  4. Get the certificate and install the vhost:
       certbot certonly --nginx -d spoken.rusty.one
       cp deploy/web/nginx-spoken.conf /etc/nginx/sites-available/spoken
       ln -s /etc/nginx/sites-available/spoken /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/
       nginx -t && systemctl reload nginx

  The rest -- the audio, the zones import and the redirects -- is the cutover, and
  deploy/web/README.md runs through it in order.
