/**
 * Seed a voice's clips from the game's own barks.
 *
 * A static segment like `merge`, so it takes precedence over [file] and can never be read as
 * a clip name.
 *
 * The clips are copied server-side from voice/npc-lines rather than uploaded, then joined
 * into one file straight away. Two reasons for merging here rather than leaving it to a
 * second call: a flavor has up to 27 clips, well past the 25 an upload may carry, and a
 * clone reads whatever is in the folder - so the steady state has to be the one merged file
 * that cloning actually wants.
