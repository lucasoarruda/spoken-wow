/**
 * Join selected clips into one.
 *
 * A static segment, so it takes precedence over [file] and `merge` can never be read as a
 * clip name.
 *
 * Deleting the sources is opt-in here, though the UI ticks it by default: cloning sends
 * every clip in the folder, so originals left beside a merge would be uploaded twice. The
 * API keeps them unless asked, so a caller that has not thought about it does not lose the
 * only copies.
