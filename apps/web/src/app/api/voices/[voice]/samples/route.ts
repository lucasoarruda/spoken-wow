/**
 * The clips for one voice: list them, add more.
 *
 * Uploads are buffered through request.formData() rather than streamed. A clip is capped at
 * 25 MiB and this is an admin-only tool with one operator, so the simpler code is worth more
 * than the memory it costs.
 *
 * Note nginx's client_max_body_size defaults to 1 MiB, which would reject every real clip
 * before it reached here — see deploy/nginx-voiceover.conf.
