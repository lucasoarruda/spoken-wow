/**
 * Turn a voice's clips into an ElevenLabs voice, in the caller's own account.
 *
 * Open to anybody who spends in the language, not only to admins: the generator resolves
 * voices by name against the key generating, so each collaborator needs the roster in their
 * own account, and this is how they put it there. It changes nothing anybody else uses — the
 * clips it reads stay an admin's to change.
 *
 * This is the endpoint that spends something: a custom voice slot, capped by the plan.
 * Replacing is delete-then-add rather than an update, because ElevenLabs has no "re-train
 * this voice" call and two voices sharing a name would make the lookup by name ambiguous —
 * it would pick whichever came back first.
