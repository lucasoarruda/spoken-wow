/**
 * Regenerate one book page, synchronously.
 *
 * One click, one request, one answer, matching both other sections. Anything larger goes
 * through the shared queue in /api/regenerate/queue; this stays direct because a single
 * page is cheap, is reversible through the archive, and deserves its result immediately
 * rather than after a round trip and a poll.
 *
 * The lineId travels in the body rather than the path because it contains a colon
 * ('b:1381'), and round-tripping that through a dynamic segment is encoding risk for no
 * benefit.
 *
 * Nothing is published afterwards. The pack's Data/Sounds.lua is built from the take table
 * when the pack is packaged, against a database synced from production, so the site has no
 * addon artifact to keep up to date.
