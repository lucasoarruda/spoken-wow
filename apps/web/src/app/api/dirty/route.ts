/**
 * Clearing the mark on audio that predates a pronunciation change.

 * One route for all three sections, because `take` and `take_ack` are one pair of tables
 * keyed by source -- three routes would be three places for the same rule to drift.
 *
 * Whoever may regenerate the language, the same boundary as a regeneration and for the same reason:
 * this says a take is fine as it stands, which is the decision NOT to spend on replacing
 * it. Both verdicts belong to the same people.
 *
 * Keyed on files, not lines. What is dirty is a recording, and 1,076 quests files are
 * addressed by several lines apiece -- see migration 0029.
