/**
 * Stop the queue.
 *
 * Pending jobs are cancelled; the handful already in flight are left to finish. Their
 * characters are at ElevenLabs and will be billed either way, so discarding the audio would
 * pay for nothing - which is also why this cannot promise the queue is empty the moment it
 * answers.
 *
 * It stops everything rather than one batch by default, because that is what a person
 * pressing Stop means: "stop, but keep spending on the other batch" is not a thing anyone
 * wants from that button. Everything is every language the caller regenerates in, though,
 * not the whole queue: a Portuguese translator's Stop halts the Portuguese work and leaves
 * the English queue running, as a global admin's halts all of it.
