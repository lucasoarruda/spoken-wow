/**
 * Wave away the finished work the panel is still reporting.
 *
 * The X used to set React state, which meant a run stayed dismissed until the next reload and
 * then came back - with its credit total - on every navigation. Dismissal belongs on the
 * server for the same reason the panel does: it is a statement about the queue, not about one
 * tab's opinion of it.
 *
 * It never touches pending or running work. Stopping a queue is /stop's job: the same X asks
 * for it on a live queue, but only after a confirmation, and never through this route.
 *
 * Anybody who regenerates in any language may press it, since everybody watches the one
 * panel: it hides news, it never stops or undoes work, so there is nothing to scope.
