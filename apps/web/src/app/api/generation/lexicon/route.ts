/**
 * The pronunciation lexicon.
 *
 * The same boundary as the generation settings, and for the same reason: GET is
 * `regenerate`, because someone about to spend characters is entitled to know how the
 * names in their line will be said, and PUT/DELETE are `configure`, because a phoneme rule
 * applies to everything anyone generates afterwards.
 *
 * PUT answers 200 even when the upload to ElevenLabs failed. The save itself succeeded, the
 * stored entries are what the page should now show, and reporting that as an error would
 * invite an admin to retype an edit that is already safely in Postgres. `syncError` and the
 * `pending` state carry the bad news instead, and POST retries just the upload.
