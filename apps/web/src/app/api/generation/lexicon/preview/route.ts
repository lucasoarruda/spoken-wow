/**
 * Hearing one lexicon entry.
 *
 * `admin`, matching the rest of the lexicon routes, and this one has a second reason: it
 * spends credits on every miss. A route anyone could hold down would be a route anyone could
 * empty the month's budget with.
 *
 * POST rather than GET even though it reads. The entry is a draft that has not been saved
 * anywhere, so there is nothing to name in a URL - and a miss is not a safe request, since
 * it costs money.
 *
 * The body is one entry plus a mode, and the entry is validated the way a saved one is. A
 * preview of an entry the lexicon would refuse to store is a preview of something that can
 * never ship.
