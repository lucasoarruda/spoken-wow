/**
 * Changing a report's status.
 *
 * A separate route rather than a second verb on /api/reports. That path's POST is open to the
 * whole internet and this one must never be; two verbs on one path with opposite access rules
 * is the arrangement a later edit quietly breaks.
 *
 * Whoever may edit the report's language rather than an admin: these are the people who
 * already act on its lines, and a report they have read and dismissed should not need an
 * admin to close. A Portuguese report is a Portuguese translator's, and not an English
 * one's.
