/**
 * A moderator's answer to "which NPC is this?", for a contribution whose envelope named its NPC
 * by id alone.
 *
 * Recorded on the contribution, not in npc_resolution: the answers there are about NPCs and are
 * not wrong, only ambiguous for this row, which could mean either kind. After this every reader
 * (the triage page, accept, the export) reads the row as if its envelope had carried the kind.
 * Refused for a row whose envelope already carried one -- the client's own observation stands.
 *
 * English regenerate only, like the other moderator routes beside it.
