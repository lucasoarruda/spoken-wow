/**
 * Regenerate one zone line, synchronously.
 *
 * One click, one request, one answer, matching the quests side. Anything larger goes
 * through the shared queue in /api/regenerate/queue; this stays direct because a single
 * line is cheap, is reversible through the archive, and deserves its result immediately
 * rather than after a round trip and a poll.
 *
 * The lineId travels in the body rather than the path for the reason the quests one does:
 * it contains colons ('s:1411:razor hill'), and round-tripping those through a dynamic
 * segment is encoding risk for no benefit.
