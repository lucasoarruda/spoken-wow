/**
 * Regenerate one line, synchronously.
 *
 * One click, one request, one answer. Mass regeneration goes through the queue in
 * /api/regenerate/queue instead; this endpoint stays direct because a single line is cheap,
 * is reversible through history, and deserves its result immediately rather than after a
 * round trip and a poll.
 *
 * The concurrency budget in lib/generation/concurrency.ts reserves a slot for exactly this,
 * so a click still lands while a batch is running.
 *
 * The lineId travels in the body rather than the path. It contains colons (`q:5:accept`,
 * `g:{hash}:m`), and round-tripping those through a dynamic segment is encoding risk for no
 * benefit.
