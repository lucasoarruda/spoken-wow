/**
 * What one line should say instead of what the corpus says it says.
 *
 * `regenerate` in English, matching regeneration rather than the lexicon: an override changes one file,
 * and the person who would have to listen to the result is the person regenerating it. A
 * lexicon rule, by contrast, applies to everything anyone generates afterwards.
 *
 * Keyed on the file, so the same whitelist that makes the audio routes traversal-proof decides
 * what may be written: a path either names a file some corpus line owns, or it does not exist.
