/**
 * The front door.
 *
 * Three sections, named by what they voice rather than by which project they came from: a
 * visitor does not know that one of these used to be at voiceover.rusty.one and another at
 * lore.rusty.one, and should not have to.
 *
 * Each card carries the addon's own icon, the same art CurseForge and the in-game addon
 * list show, so somebody arriving from either recognises what they came for. They are the
 * exported SVGs from pipelines/*, copied into public/icons/ -- see the note there.
 *
 * The store links sit BELOW the card rather than inside it, and that is structural
 * rather than aesthetic: the card is one big anchor, and an anchor inside an anchor is
 * invalid HTML that browsers resolve by closing the outer one early.
 *
 * TWO STORES, AND NOT EVERY ADDON IS ON BOTH. The slugs are identical on CurseForge and
 * Wago, so one slug addresses both -- but a sound pack is 280-452 MB and Wago's upload
 * endpoint refuses a file that size. Those rows carry `release`, the pack's tag prefix on
 * GitHub, and link there instead: a player who installed the addon from Wago still has
 * somewhere to get its audio. The link is the releases query rather than a tag, so it does
 * not go stale the next time the audio is built.
