/**
 * Where the game's Report button sends a player.
 *
 * Not the explorer: someone arriving from the game is a player, not an editor. They see the
 * line, hear the take that is live, and file a report - nothing else.
 *
 * An address that resolves to nothing still renders the form. "The addon sent me to a page
 * that knows nothing about this quest" is information about the data module, and 404ing it
 * would throw that away.
 *
 * One catch-all segment serves both address shapes, so there is one page rather than two that
 * drift apart.
