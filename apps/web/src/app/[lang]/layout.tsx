/**
 * The root layout, under the language: every page is in exactly one, and says so in
 * <html lang>.
 *
 * pageLang answers an English page without a query or a session read; only another language
 * asks whether it is switched on, and whether the visitor is an admin who may see it early.
 *
 * NOTHING HERE IS PRERENDERED, including the four English pages that were (the landing page,
 * /quests, /login and /register). A generateStaticParams for English would keep them static,
 * but it also makes Next render every other language as a static page on first request, and
 * the admin check above reads the session -- which a static render may not, and which fails
 * as a 500 at runtime rather than at build. Those four pages do no database work for English,
 * so rendering them per request costs a React render and nothing else.
