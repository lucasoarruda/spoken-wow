/**
 * The triage list for pasted envelopes.
 *
 * A table for the same reason ReportTable is one: triage is a scan down a column, and the
 * submitted text -- which can run to a full quest's worth of dialogue -- sits behind a
 * `<details>` so a long paste does not push every row after it off the screen (the reasoning
 * CATEGORY_COLUMN gives in lib/reports/reports.ts for the same shape of problem).
 *
 * Never renders `ip`, `name` or `email`: reports/ReportTable shows a reporter's own name
 * because they gave it to have their report followed up on, but a contribution's identifying
 * fields exist only for abuse response, not for triage to read. `body` -- the optional
 * complaint -- is different: it's the one field a player filled in specifically to be read,
 * so it is rendered below, deliberately included in the Row this component accepts.
 *
 * `initial` is typed as `ContributionRow`, not the full `Contribution`, and page.tsx must
 * project down to it before passing rows here: this is a "use client" component, so whatever
 * shape its props carry crosses into the RSC flight payload and is readable in devtools
 * regardless of what this file goes on to render. `ip`, `name`, `email` and `raw` have no
 * reason to make that crossing at all.
