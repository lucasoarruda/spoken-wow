 * just ran is a switch nobody uses twice.
 *
 * Asked of the API in the browser rather than read by the layout, for the reason UserMenu
 * reads the session there: the layout would otherwise put a query in front of every English
 * page. Renders nothing while only one language is on, which is the site as it stands.
