 * What a 428 from a paid route looks like on screen.
 *
 * The refusal has to explain itself, because it is not the one people expect: the button
 * was there, the role is right, and the failure is a piece of setup nobody has mentioned
 * yet. So it says whose credits are spent and links to the page that fixes it, rather than
 * surfacing a status code next to a row.
 *
 * Shared by both sections, because the guard is: requireApiKey refuses a quests
 * regeneration exactly as it refuses a zones one. Worded for either provider, because the
 * message it is handed -- requireApiKey's -- already names which key is missing.
