/**
 * What the queue is doing, while it does it.
 *
 * Sits above the player rather than replacing it, because a batch takes minutes and the
 * point of watching is to play the lines as they land.
 *
 * It shows the whole queue, not this tab's work: Stop reaches every batch the viewer may
 * stop, and each person's queue is listed so a waiting batch says why it has not started.
 *
 * The cost shown is the real one, summed from what ElevenLabs charged each line, not the
 * estimate the dialog offered - so an estimate that was wrong is visible rather than quietly
 * preserved.
 *
 * `note` answers the click rather than the batch: it says what the enqueue request itself
 * reported (refused outright, or queued fewer files than quoted because another admin had
 * already claimed some) - information the server snapshot has no field for, since it is
 * about one request rather than the queue's ongoing state.
 *
 * The X means "I am done with this". On a live queue that is a request to stop it, which spends
 * nobody's money but throws away a run someone may be waiting on, so it asks first. On a
 * settled one it closes the panel and dismisses the run on the server, so the next reload does
 * not bring it back. The panel does both itself rather than leaving them to each explorer:
 * three copies of the dismissal had drifted into three different bugs.
