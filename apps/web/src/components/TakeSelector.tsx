/**
 * Which take is live, and every take it could be instead.
 *
 * ONE CONTROL, NOT TWO. The version label and the way back used to be separate things, and
 * only on some rows: zones printed `v3` beside a restore button that silently put back
 * whichever clip was newest, quests hid a history popover behind a second icon, and books
 * had neither although its takes were in the same table. The label is the trigger now --
 * the number is the question, and "which other numbers are there" is what a click asks.
 *
 * Restoring moves the live flag rather than writing a new take, so this list is the set of
 * takes the line has had and not a log of who looked at it.
 *
 * EVERY TAKE IS OFFERED. This used to grey out the ones whose bytes it could not find,
 * which meant drawing a list of takes required listing a directory -- and where the archive
 * is not on the machine serving the page, every past take looked lost. The database says
 * what was cut; whether the bytes are still there is answered by playing or restoring, and
 * both say so when they fail.
 *
 * A take this app did not cut is labelled `no record`, and shows no model and no cost:
 * nothing wrote down how it was made, and inventing a value would suggest it could be
 * reproduced. That is most quests takes -- the corpus was narrated by tts_cli, and old
 * pruning destroyed the rows of many re-rolls whose clips survived.
