/**
 * Narrating one book page, on the shared queue's terms.
 *
 * Deliberately the zones narrator's voice: the design calls for one narrator across the
 * section, and resolving a second would be a second answer to "who reads this", with
 * nothing asking the question. Everything from resolving it to committing the take is
 * lib/generation/narrated.ts, shared with zones; what is here is finding a page and
 * deciding whether it can be voiced.
