/**
 * A page's words, and the one write that changes them.
 *
 * SERVER ONLY. book_line has been versioned since 0026 -- `origin in ('extracted','edited')`,
 * an editedBy, a note -- and until now nothing wrote an `edited` row: the only way a page's
 * text could change was a re-import from the dump. So a reported mistake in a book could be
 * read, triaged and regenerated, but not actually fixed, which made the report queue a list
 * of things nobody could act on.
 *
 * The zones equivalent (lib/zones/lore.ts) is the model, down to the optimistic version
 * check, and the differences are the two corpora's own:
 *
 *   * A page has one text, where a zone line has a full and a short.
 *   * The structural fields -- which book, which page number, what opens it -- are copied
 *     from the live row rather than accepted from the caller. Which pages exist is the
 *     extract's business (0026 says so plainly), and an API that let a text edit move a
 *     page to another book would be one bad request away from a page the addon cannot find.
 *
 * EDITING DOES NOT REGENERATE. The new text hashes differently from the take that was
 * spoken, so the page simply reads "audio outdated" and joins the worklist like any other
 * stale line. Coupling a free action to a paid one is how a typo fix ends up costing
 * credits.
