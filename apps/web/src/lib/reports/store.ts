/**
 * The only module that knows the report table's column names, following lib/generation/queue.ts.
 *
 * One table for both sides of the site (migration 0021), so every read takes a source filter
 * rather than pinning one: the triage page shows both by default, because a report is a
 * person waiting for an answer and which corpus it is about does not change how long they
 * have been waiting.
 *
 * countRecent is the rate limiter's entire implementation. It counts in Postgres rather than
 * in process memory so the limit survives a pm2 restart, which is precisely the moment a
 * flood would otherwise get through. It does not filter by source, deliberately: the limit is
 * on a person, and filing ten from each page is filing twenty.
