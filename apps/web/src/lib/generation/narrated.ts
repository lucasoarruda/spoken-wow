/**
 * Narrating one line in a section read by the single narrator: zones and books.
 *
 * Both sections voice every line with the one narrator resolved from generation_setting and
 * the pronunciation lexicon, give every line a file of its own, and record a duration --
 * so everything from resolving that narrator to committing the take is the same, and was
 * written twice until a new take field (the lead-in) had to be added to both copies. What
 * stays in each section is what is actually about it: how a line is found and whether it
 * can be voiced at all.
 *
 * The result is a RegenerateResult rather than an exception because the worker decides
 * what to do next from `kind` and `fatal`: running out of credits fails every remaining
 * line identically and stops the batch, while one line that cannot be voiced is one line.
 *
 * THE REQUEST ITSELF IS the Speaker's (./speakers), the same one quests narrates through.
 *
 * The narrator is the `narrator-male` slot on /voices, resolved by name against the account
 * the request is spending from. It is the same roster entry the quests side narrates its
 * stage directions with; the two were always the same voice on the same account, and only
 * the zones site's old config file made them look separate. The model, settings and
 * lexicon are the ones both sections read, so a narrator is never cut with a different
 * model from the NPC beside it without somebody choosing that.
