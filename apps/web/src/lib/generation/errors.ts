/**
 * Turning a provider's failure into something a batch can act on.
 *
 * The browser drives a batch one line at a time, so every failure needs an answer to one
 * question: keep going, or stop? Running out of credits means every remaining line will fail
 * the same way, and grinding through ninety more requests to discover that ninety more times
 * is the behaviour this exists to prevent. A single malformed line is the opposite.
 *
 * The upstream text is always carried through verbatim. It is the only thing that
 * distinguishes "your plan does not allow cloning" from "that sample was unusable", and
 * losing it behind a tidy message turns every failure into a support question.
 *
 * Nothing here throws. An error body arriving in a shape this does not recognise must not
 * become a 500 - that would replace a diagnosable upstream failure with an opaque local one.
