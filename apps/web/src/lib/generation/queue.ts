/**
 * Every SQL statement the regeneration queue needs, and nothing else.
 *
 * No ElevenLabs, no leadership, no timers: this module is the store, and it is the only one
 * that knows the column names. worker.ts decides what to do; this decides what is written.
 *
 * Rows are keyed on the file for the reason migration 0013 records - a job is one mp3, not
 * one line - and the exclusions that keep the queue honest live in the schema, not here.
 *
 * ONE QUEUE FOR BOTH SECTIONS. There is one ElevenLabs plan behind it, the panel shows what
 * everyone is spending, and two queues would need a scheduler between them to decide which
 * is allowed to run. The source rides on each job and decides which generator worker.ts
 * hands it to; it is also half the credit guard's key, because the two sides name files by
 * their own frozen rules and a collision would mean one section's job silently blocking the
 * other's - which reads as "nothing happened when I pressed Regenerate".
 *
 * THE LANGUAGE RIDES ON EACH JOB TOO, and is the guard's third term for the same reason: a
 * Portuguese take of a file is a different recording from the English one, and queueing both
 * is two jobs rather than a duplicate. It is what the generator is asked to speak in.
