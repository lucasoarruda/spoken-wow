/**
 * What a batch will cost, and what it did cost.
 *
 * ElevenLabs does not bill the characters you send. It bills round(characters * rate), and
 * the rate belongs to the plan rather than the request - 0.55 on the account this was built
 * against, and half that for the flash and turbo models, so a 310-character line cost 170.
 *
 * That rate cannot be read from the API and must not be hardcoded: it is a property of
 * someone's plan and discounts, and a constant here would quietly misprice every batch the
 * day either changes. So the rate is *learned* from what this account has actually been
 * charged, which the `character-cost` response header reports exactly.
 *
 * Until there is anything to learn from, estimates use 1 credit per character. That is the
 * documented list rate and an upper bound on every plan observed, which is the right
 * direction to be wrong in when the number is there to stop someone spending a month's
 * budget by accident.
 *
 * fish.audio bills differently and simply: list price in dollars per UTF-8 byte, with no
 * plan in between. A fish.audio Rate is dollars per character, so an estimate is the same
 * multiplication whichever provider it is for; the bytes-per-character of the language is
 * folded into the rate, learned from past fish.audio takes the same way credits are (see
 * calibration.ts). Credits and dollars are never added together anywhere.
 *
 * Everything here is pure and free of node imports, because the confirm dialog is a client
 * component and must show the same figure the server would. Reading the calibration out of
 * Postgres lives in calibration.ts.

 *    50 chars -> 27.5  -> billed 28   (half up, and half to even, both give 28)
 *   310 chars -> 170.5 -> billed 170  (half up gives 171; only half to even gives 170)
