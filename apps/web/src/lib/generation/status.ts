/**
 * What the browser needs to know before it starts spending: which voices exist, and how

 *
 * Memoised with a short TTL because a batch is a loop over one endpoint per line. Asking
 * ElevenLabs which voices exist before each of a hundred lines would triple the request
 * count for an answer that cannot change mid-batch - voices are created on /voices, and
 * that page busts this cache directly.
 *
 * Memoised PER KEY, because the key is which account is being described. Two people with
 * keys on different ElevenLabs accounts see different voices and different balances, and
 * one memo for both would show whichever of them asked first.
 *
 * A failure is reported, never thrown. The page is expected to work with no key at all -
 * that is the state the project was in until a plan was bought - and a batch that cannot
 * show a balance should still be able to run.
