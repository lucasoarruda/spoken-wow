/**
 * The values the filter dropdowns can offer.
 *
 * Races and genders are the voiced list in lib/voices/voices.ts, so a race-gender added there
 * is filterable before any line uses it. Flavors and voices are derived from the corpus, as
 * voiceSlots is (lib/voices/slots.ts), plus the flavors voices.ts declares and the voices it
 * names that the corpus does not speak yet.
 *
 * Being closed sets also makes them a whitelist, which is what lets /api/search take these
 * straight from a query string.
 *
 * `source` and `npcType` are absent on purpose: they are closed unions on CorpusLine, so
 * their lists live next to the type in lib/search.ts.
