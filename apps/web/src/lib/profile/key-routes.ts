 * control, not to an admin. A response carries `ApiKeyStatus`, the last four characters and
 * when it was verified, which proves a key is set and is useless for spending with.
 *
 * Only somebody who spends somewhere may store one: a member has no action a key would
 * unblock, so storing their credential would be collecting a secret this app has no use for.
