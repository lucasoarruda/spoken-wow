/**
 * Putting an earlier take back, in one place for all three sections.
 *
 * ONE STEP: move the live flag onto that take. No file is read, copied or written. Every
 * take is its own file in the archive, written once when it was cut, and the live one is
 * whichever row says so -- the site plays it from there, and a pack build copies it into
 * Sounds/ (scripts/audio/sounds.mjs). So a restore is a statement about which take is
 * right, the same thing it means for a lore version (lib/zones/lore.ts), and it cannot lose
 * audio because it touches none.
 *
 * NO NEW ROW, for the same reason: the history is what this line has been, and nothing
 * about putting an old take back is a new take.
 *
 * A take whose clip was not kept cannot be made live: the line would then have a live take
 * with nothing to play, and the pack would ship a gap where it had audio. Whether a kept
 * clip is really on this machine's disk is not asked -- the player reports a missing file
 * when somebody presses play.
