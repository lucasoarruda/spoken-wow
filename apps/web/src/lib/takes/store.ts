/**
 * Every take of every line, for all three sections, over one table and one archive rule.
 *
 * The `take` table has held all three since migration 0020, but only the quests side ever
 * had a history panel to read it with: zones could undo its newest take and books had no
 * way back at all. The difference was never in the data. It was that each section reached
 * its own audio through its own module, so a panel written against one of them could not be
 * shown on the other two.
 *
 * This is the seam that makes them one. What differs between the sections is where the
 * bytes live and how a file is named -- frozen rules, per AGENTS.md -- so that is what the
 * adapter holds, and everything else is written once here.
 *
 * Keyed on `(source, file)` because that is what `take_current_idx` is on, and because a
 * quests file is spoken by several NPCs: "restore this line" is really "restore this file".
