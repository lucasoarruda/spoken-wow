/**
 * Committing a take, for all three sections.
 *
 * This used to be written three times -- quests in generation/history.ts, zones through the
 * pipeline's store.mjs, books in books/store.ts -- and a rule changed in one did not reach
 * the others.
 *
 * AUDIO FILES ARE WRITTEN ONCE AND NEVER CHANGED. A take is one file in the archive and one
 * row; committing adds both and touches nothing already there. There is no "store" holding
 * whichever take is live: which take is live is the row's `isCurrent`, and the addon's
 * Sounds/ folder is assembled from the live rows when a pack is built
 * (scripts/audio/sounds.mjs). So a new take cannot overwrite an old one, and there is no
 * ordering between a store and the rows for a crash to fall in the middle of.
 *
 * THE ORDER: the bytes first, under a name that includes their hash, then the row. A crash
 * between the two leaves a file no row names -- unreferenced and harmless -- never a row
 * whose file is missing.
 *
 * The caller holds the file's lock, `${source}:${file}` (generation/lock.ts), across the
 * whole generation, so that two requests for one line cannot both spend credits. Every
 * section's regeneration and the restore route take the same key.
