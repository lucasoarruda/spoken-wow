/**
 * The quest corpus as the explorer sees it: every line, with who speaks it.
 *
 * SERVER ONLY, and the counterpart of lib/zones/catalogue.ts and lib/books/catalogue.ts --
 * the third section finally reading its corpus from the same place as the other two. It
 * used to come from corpus/corpus.json.gz, memoised forever on the reasoning that "the
 * corpus ships inside the release and cannot change under a running process". That stopped
 * being true the moment a line could be edited here.
 *
 * The rows are joined back into exactly the shape the file had -- one row per (line ×
 * speaker) -- so lib/search.ts, lib/facets.ts and everything downstream are unchanged.
 * That is deliberate: the point of this change is where the words live, not what the
 * explorer does with them.
 *
 * MEMOISED AGAINST A STAMP THE TABLES THEMSELVES CARRY, copied from books
 * (lib/books/catalogue.ts): max id, count, and the sum of live ids. Three terms because
 * there are three ways the table moves -- an edit inserts a version so the highest id
 * moves, an import can delete so the count moves, and a restore moves the live flag
 * between rows that already exist, which only the sum of live ids notices. The speakers
 * count separately, being replaced wholesale on every import.
 *
 * pm2 runs two workers, so an in-process invalidation would be a memo one worker drops and
 * the other keeps serving. There is deliberately no invalidate() for that reason.
