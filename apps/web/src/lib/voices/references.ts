/**
 * The clip each voice slot is spoken from on fish.audio, per language.
 *
 * fish.audio is used zero-shot: every request carries 10-30 seconds of the voice and exactly
 * what is said in it. So a reference is a window cut from one of the slot's clips on
 * /voices, a transcript of that window, and a row in fish_reference (migration 0042) saying
 * which clip and where. Nothing is created in anybody's fish.audio account, which is why a
 * reference made by one admin works with every collaborator's key.
 *
 * The transcript matters as much as the audio -- fish.audio's guidance is that it must match
 * exactly, punctuation included -- so it is fish.audio's own speech-to-text, open to
 * correction by hand.
