/**
 * The access boundary for the voice routes.
 *
 * Every /api/voices route calls one of these. The role checks in components only decide what
 * to draw — see canRegenerate's comment in permissions.ts — so the server check cannot be
 * skipped just because the UI would not have offered the control.
 *
 * Two levels, as on the page. Changing what a voice is made from — its clips, its fish.audio
 * reference — is shared by everybody who generates with it, so it is canManageVoices. Hearing
 * those sources and cloning them into one's own ElevenLabs account touch nobody else, so they
 * are open to whoever spends in the language (canViewVoices).
 *
 * 403 rather than /voices' 404: hiding a page from a member is worth doing, but pretending
 * an API route does not exist only makes a real misconfiguration harder to diagnose.
