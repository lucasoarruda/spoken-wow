 * not speak yet -- a declared flavor, or a bare `race-gender` -- since a voice has to exist to
 * be cloned before the first line for it is accepted. The names are
 * the ones tts_cli/voices.py matches on: `race-gender-flavor`, and nothing else is usable,
 * because a stock library voice's name cannot express that mapping.

 * slot name safe to use as a path segment. Same reasoning as isSafeAudioPath in range.ts.
