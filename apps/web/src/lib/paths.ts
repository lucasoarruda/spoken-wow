// and pipelines/quests/.env with the ElevenLabs key and the database password in it.
// The old tracing root hid that by putting this directory out of range, and widening
// the root -- which pnpm's hoisted node_modules forced -- exposed it. One segment kept
// out of the literal makes the expression opaque to the tracer and identical at runtime.
