/**
 * Narrating one zone line, on the shared queue's terms.
 *
 * What the zones site had here was a batch runner: a Map of batches on globalThis, its own
 * concurrency limiter, its own rate-limit backoff, its own stop flag. All of that is the
 * queue's now (lib/generation/queue.ts, worker.ts), which is what let its pm2 config stop
 * pinning a single worker. What is left is the part that is actually about zone lore:
 * which text, which voice, where the bytes go, and what the take records.
 *
 * The result is the quests side's RegenerateResult, not an exception, because the worker
 * decides what to do next from `kind` and `fatal`: running out of credits fails every
 * remaining line identically and stops the batch, while one line whose text cannot be
 * voiced is just one line.
 *
 * Resolving the narrator, the request and the commit are lib/generation/narrated.ts, shared
 * with books. Zones used to reach into pipelines/zones/tools/voice/elevenlabs.mjs for the
 * request, which left the repository with two ElevenLabs clients and put one of them in a
 * pipeline that does no generating.
