/**
 * The bridge to pipelines/zones/tools.
 *
 * Every import that crosses out of this app goes through this one file, so the blast radius
 * of the boundary is one module rather than scattered `../../../../pipelines/...` specifiers.
 * next.config.ts sets outputFileTracingRoot to the repo root, without which Next traces
 * dependencies from apps/web alone and leaves all of this out of the build.
 *
 * WHY IMPORT RATHER THAN SHELL OUT. Spawning `node tools/voice/generate.mjs` would have kept
 * the boundary clean and cost the two things that matter: the typed failure kinds from
 * elevenlabs.mjs (quota vs auth vs rate-limit, which decide whether the rest of a batch is
 * worth attempting) and the character-cost header, which is the only authoritative record of
 * what a line was billed. Parsing those back out of stdout is how the CLI and the app start
 * disagreeing.
 *
 * These modules are dependency-free ESM with no build step. TypeScript reads them with
 * allowJs and infers their shapes; the `as` casts below are the one place those inferred
 * shapes are pinned to what this app relies on, so a change in pipelines/zones shows up as a
 * type error here rather than as undefined at runtime.
 *
 * WHAT IS DELIBERATELY NOT HERE, and was on the zones site:
 *
 *   loadConfig / saveConfig / draftConfig / resolveVoiceId
 *     The narrator's voice, model and settings came from tools/voice/config.json. They come
 *     from the database now, shared with the quests side: the roster on /voices, the model
 *     and voice settings from the generating collaborator's own generation_preference, the
 *     dictionary from pronunciation_lexicon.
 *     config.json is down to a fallback credit rate for the reporting CLI.
 *
 *   synthesize / verifyKey / fetchTier / listVoices / apiKey
 *     Every request to ElevenLabs is the site's, through lib/generation/tts.ts and
 *     lib/voices/elevenlabs.ts, with a key belonging to the signed-in user rather than to
 *     the machine. The pipeline does no generating and holds no client.
 *
 *   Limiter / afterRateLimit / budgetFor's caller
 *     Concurrency is the shared queue's, in lib/generation/concurrency.ts. Two answers to
 *     "how many at once" against one ElevenLabs plan is one too many.
