/**
 * Who is speaking a contributed line.
 *
 * Three sources, in this order, and the order is the whole design:
 *
 *   1. A moderator's answer, if one exists. They may know something no data source does.
 *   2. The corpus, for an NPC it already carries. Exact, including the flavor, which is
 *      recovered from display data no client API exposes.
 *   3. What the client saw: a model file id, which names a race and a gender but says nothing
 *      about flavor, so the flavor is defaulted and the row is left unconfirmed.
 *
 * An NPC that answers to none of them resolves to no race, which is a normal outcome rather
 * than a failure: the corpus already carries `narrator-male` for things that are not a race.
