 * "Everything a moderator still owes a decision" -- not a fifth provenance, a sentinel over the

 * exactly the two provenances `confirmed` can never be true for, which is the whole reason this
 * queue exists: the brief's own words for it are "tweak unconfirmed NPCs later".
 *
 * A single-select Speaker dropdown of the four provenances alone cannot express that union --
 * picking "Client guess" or "No race" narrows to one of the two, never both in one click -- so
 * dropping the old Confirmed/Unconfirmed axis entirely (both of which were themselves unions of
 * two provenances, not renamed single ones) would have quietly removed a real view rather than
 * a duplicate one. This sentinel restores the "unconfirmed" half of that view without bringing
 * back a second dropdown or the "confirmed" half: nobody triages the settled rows, so there is
 * no queue that ever wants "corpus or moderator" as one filter.
 *
 * Kept off `isProvenance`'s own union on purpose: a value it doesn't recognise must fall back to
 * "all" (page.tsx's own parsing already does this for any unrecognised string), not silently
 * mean "needs a decision" -- the two are handled by two separate checks in matchesSpeaker so a
 * typo in the query string can never masquerade as this filter.
