/**
 * Resolving a contribution -- the route's whole verb, now that accepting a quests row can also
 * write a line.
 *
 * Everything except quests-accept is the plain status flip setContributionStatus always did:
 * books and zones already have their own path from a contribution to a corpus entry
 * (existing.ts), and a moderator moving any row to "new" or "rejected" changes nothing else.
 * Quests-accept is different because the accepted line must appear in the explorer, and the
 * explorer reads the quest tables (lib/quests/catalogue.ts) -- so accepting writes into them:
 * a `quest_line` row with origin "contributed" and a `quest_line_speaker` row carrying the
 * contribution's id, in the same transaction as the status update. Re-accepting must not
 * duplicate, and a status flip with no line, or a line with no status flip, is a state nothing
 * else here is built to handle.
 *
 * The speaker row is what marks a line as contributed, not the line's origin: an editor's text
 * fix adds an "edited" version on top, and the line is still one a player sent. It is also what
 * the importer (tts_cli/corpus_db.py) leaves alone when it replaces every extracted speaker.
 *
 * The contributed text is what the player's client displayed -- the game's own substitutions
 * (a class name standing in for `$c`, and so on) are already applied. Stored as-is in both
 * `text` and `originalText`; reversing a substitution is guesswork this module has no business
 * doing, and an editor already has the text-override flow for exactly this kind of fix.
