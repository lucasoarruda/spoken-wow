# The books corpus
#
# Its own path, because books cannot be seeded the way the other two are. The quests corpus
# ships inside the release as a committed file and the zones one is imported from the other
# droplet's database; books is extracted from a vmangos MySQL that exists only on a
# maintainer's machine, so the rows travel from there or not at all.
#
# THE DROPLET CANNOT RE-SEED ITSELF. If this table is ever lost there, it comes back from a
# local extract and this target -- which is the reason it is a target rather than a command
# somebody remembers.

# a take whose lineId no longer resolves, an override naming a file the corpus dropped.
