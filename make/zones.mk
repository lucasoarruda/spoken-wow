# another language's pack (addons/SpokenZonesAudio_esMX). pipelines/zones/tools/voice/store.mjs
# reads it; sounds, pull-live and package-audio take the same LOCALE, so one variable on the
# command line moves the whole chain and a run cannot build one language's lookup over
# another's clips.
VOICE_LANG = SPOKEN_ZONES_LANG=$(or $(LOCALE),enUS)

# The manifest comes from Postgres when DATABASE_URL is set and from the committed files
# otherwise, and the repo-root .env sets it -- so a laptop whose Postgres is not running gets
# ECONNREFUSED out of every audio target, which is not a failure anyone reading
# "validate the sound pack" expects.
#
# Passing it empty is what env.mjs documents as "use the files": an already-set variable always
# wins over .env. Defined-but-empty counts, so this is the default and
# `make zones-package-audio DATABASE_URL=postgres://...` still reads the database.
VOICE_DB = DATABASE_URL=$(DATABASE_URL)

	@$(VOICE_LANG) node pipelines/zones/tools/voice/export-manifest.mjs

#-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# The site's database
#
# Optional to the addon build: with DATABASE_URL unset every target above still
# works against pipelines/zones/tools/voice/manifest.json. The schema and its migrations
# belong to apps/web now; see make/web.mk and deploy/web/README.md.
#-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

export: ## Write pipelines/zones/tools/voice/manifest.json from the database
	@$(VOICE_LANG) node pipelines/zones/tools/voice/export-manifest.mjs

#-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# The lore corpus
#
# The text lives in the database so it can be rewritten from the explorer, and the
# addon ships the two committed Lua files. These targets are the traffic between
# them. Neither is needed to build the addon from a clone: without DATABASE_URL the
# committed files are the whole story, which is what keeps the release path free of
# Postgres.
#-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

lore-import: ## Seed lore_line from the committed Lua data files (idempotent)
	@node pipelines/zones/tools/lore/import.mjs

# A language's place names, from the alias table the addon ships (built from the game's
# AreaTable). The prose has no such source and is written on the site. LOCALE and not LANG,
# which every shell sets.
lore-import-names: ## Name zones and subzones in a language from tools/seed/area-names.json (LOCALE=deDE)
	@test -n "$(LOCALE)" || { echo "lore-import-names: set LOCALE, e.g. LOCALE=deDE"; exit 2; }

lore-export: ## Write addons/SpokenZones/Data/<lang>/*.lua, every translated language, from the database
	@node pipelines/zones/tools/lore/export.mjs

lore-check: ## Confirm the committed Lua matches the database
	@node pipelines/zones/tools/lore/export.mjs --check

# Translations arrive as a spreadsheet, not through a model: a sheet goes out with the
# English beside the blanks and comes back filled in. Both are free. The upload
# follows the scraper's rules -- unchanged text records nothing, and a hand edit made
# in the explorer is never overwritten -- so a re-upload is always safe to run.
lore-rewrite: ## Rewrite one zone's lore from the full wiki article (ZONE=1420, costs credits)
	@test -n "$(ZONE)" || { echo "usage: make lore-rewrite ZONE=1420"; exit 1; }
	@node pipelines/zones/tools/rewrite-lore.mjs --zone $(ZONE) --variant both --dry-run

#-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Languages
#
# A non-English client reports its own area names -- "Sengende Schlucht", not
# "Burning Steppes" -- and the corpus is keyed by the English one in every
# language. Without these tables such a client matches no subzone at all, which
# is what it did for the addon's whole life before they existed. Regenerate only
# when the pinned client build in pipelines/zones/tools/lib/db2.mjs moves.
#-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

aliases: ## Rebuild Data/<locale>/Aliases.lua and seed/area-names.json from the client's AreaTable
	@node pipelines/zones/tools/locale/build-aliases.mjs
	@node pipelines/zones/tools/locale/build-languages.mjs

languages: ## Rebuild Data/Languages.lua -- what each language covers, and whether it ships
	@node pipelines/zones/tools/locale/build-languages.mjs

# Reports coverage and confirms Languages.lua still matches it. An untranslated
# language is not a failure; a stale Languages.lua is, because it decides which
# languages players are offered.
locale-check: ## Report per-language string coverage, and check Languages.lua is current
	@node pipelines/zones/tools/locale/check-strings.mjs
	@node pipelines/zones/tools/locale/build-languages.mjs --check
