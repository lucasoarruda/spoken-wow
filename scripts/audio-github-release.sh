# WHY THIS EXISTS. CurseForge takes the packs and Wago does not: each is 280-452 MB and
# Cloudflare answers 413 to Wago's version endpoint before Wago sees the body. A player who
# installs an addon from Wago therefore has nowhere to get its audio, so the packs get a
# second home here, where the ceiling is 2 GB a file.
#
# WHY IT IS NOT THE WORKFLOW. .github/workflows/release-addons.yaml builds its zips on the
# runner, which the packs cannot be: the audio is outside git (see .gitignore) and exists only
# on the machine that generated it. So this uploads what is already in dist/ from that machine,
# the same contract scripts/*/release.sh has, and the workflow keeps the addons.
#
# ONE TAG PER PACK PROJECT. A pack is versioned by the module last built for it and the three
# groups move independently -- zones audio is at 2.0.1 while the quests packs are at 2.0.0 --
# so a tag spanning them would name a version that is only true for one. The tags are
# deliberately outside the prefixes release-addons.yaml watches (spoken/, quests/, zones/):
# that workflow would try to build an addon from a pack tag and fail the tag.
#
# The meta addon has no release here on purpose. SpokenQuestsAudio is a few kilobytes that
# declares the four packs as dependencies, which only an addon manager resolves; downloaded by
# hand it is an empty folder, so the four packs are what this offers.
