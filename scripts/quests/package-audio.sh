# The store is 3.2 GB of mono speech, almost all of it 128 kbps CBR from ElevenLabs;
# 48 files are still the 64 kbps pack this project inherited. Shipping that as-is
# asks a player to download three gigabytes for audio most of them hear once per
# quest. docs/pack-size.md measures every encode that was considered.
#
# THE SHIPPING PACK IS OGG VORBIS AT 44.1 kHz (`ogg-q0-44k`), which make passes in:
# 3.2 GB of masters become ~1.3 GB, split five ways. Vorbis is worth 1.3-1.5x over
# LAME at these rates, and it is VBR, so the bits follow the voice instead of padding
# silence to a constant rate.
#
# A 22.05 kHz downsample halves that again and speech survives an 11 kHz ceiling, so
# it shipped as a second family for a while. It is retired - one family is one set of
# projects, one set of folder names and one answer to "which do I install" - and the
# profile stays available here for anyone measuring. docs/pack-size.md has the numbers.
#
# The masters stay in audio/ untouched, so raising the shipped quality later is a
# re-run of this script rather than a second purchase from ElevenLabs, which bills
# characters and not bytes.
#
# A pack ships ONE format, because the module resolves every sound through a single
# GetSoundPath. So for an ogg profile every clip is encoded; the bitrate threshold
# below only decides anything when the target is mp3 and the clip is already mp3,
# where a second lossy pass over a 64 kbps file would be no smaller and audibly
# worse. See tools/plan_transcode.py.
#
# Separate from `python cli-main.py build`, which copies the store as it finds it.
# That command is still what assembles the module - this stages a transcoded store
# and hands it over, so there is one definition of what a module contains.
#
# Durations come out right without doing anything: build computes
# sound_length_table.lua from the files it just copied, and mutagen reads a VBR
# mp3's Xing header and an Ogg page's granule position alike. A table built from
# the masters and shipped beside transcodes would drift, which is the failure this
# ordering avoids.
