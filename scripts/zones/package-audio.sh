# A language other than English is built from addons/SpokenZonesAudio_<lang> into a folder of
# the same name, at the standard tier only (tiersFor and packFolder in
# pipelines/zones/tools/lib/locales.mjs), and its .toc says which language it narrates.
#
# Two tiers exist because this is a ~790MB download at the source bitrate, which
# is a lot to ask for narration that is mostly listened to once per zone. The
# standard tier is VBR mono (lame -V6, ~50kbps effective on speech): close to
# transparent for narration, and VBR spends the bits where the voice needs them
# instead of padding silence to a constant rate. The pack keeps "64" in its name
# and .toc as the nominal tier label.
#
# Separate from package.sh because the two addons are released on their own
# cadences: most ZoneLore releases do not touch a single voiceline, and the audio
# should not ride along with a Lua bugfix.
#
# ElevenLabs bills characters, not bytes, so the audio is generated at the highest
# quality the plan allows and shrunk here instead. That keeps a high-quality master
# on disk: raising a shipped bitrate later is a re-run of this script rather than
# a second purchase.
#
# Each tier ships as its own addon folder so a player can install both and switch
# between them in-game. They share one generated Data/Sounds.lua, which reads its
# own folder name and tier out of the .toc at load time -- see build-lookup.mjs.
