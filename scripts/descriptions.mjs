// CurseForge has no API for project descriptions, summaries or categories --
// upload-file is the only write endpoint it offers, and metadata editing is an
// open feature request rather than a thing. So a project page is updated by
// pasting into a web form, and the only question is where the text being pasted
// comes from.
//
// It comes from here. Each file under publishers/ is one project page: the
// frontmatter is everything the form asks for besides the body, and the body is
// the description itself. Where a page names an addonReadme, the README that
// ships inside the zip is generated from the same body, so the page a player
// reads before installing and the file they get afterwards cannot say different
// things.
//
// ONE DIRECTORY PER PROJECT GROUP, each with its own published.json: publishers/
// quests/, zones/ and spoken/. They are separate because the groups are released
// separately and their hashes should not move together, and because the groups
// came from separate repositories and their page sets are still edited at
// different times.
//
// The one thing this cannot do is confirm what is actually live on the site.
// `--published` records a hash of every page, and is a claim you make after
// pasting rather than something verified here; `--drift` reports what has changed
// since, which is what scripts/*/release.sh prints before an upload.
